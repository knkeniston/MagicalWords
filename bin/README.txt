CS 320 - Prototype

This is a prototype of our Magical Words game.
It includes the basic functionality to play the game, which is creating a magical girl player and
4 witches, assigning each of the witches a word with a length corresponding to the current level,
and the functionality for the magical girl to type the word and to defeat the witch.
The witch will then respawn with a new word for the player/magical girl to type. After 15 witches
are killed then it moves up a level.
Points and health loss are not yet implemented into the program.

To run the game, open the ExampleTypingGame folder in Eclipse and run the Main.java file.

Instructions for playing the game:
Type the word that one of the witches has above their head to kill the witch and (eventually)
earn points and move onto the next level.
